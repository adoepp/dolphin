abstract: The recent advent of deep artificial neural networks has resulted in a
  dramatic increase in performance for object classification and detection.
  While pre-trained with everyday objects, we find that a state-of-the-art
  object detection architecture can very efficiently be fine-tuned to work on a
  variety of object detection tasks in a high-power laser laboratory. In this
  paper, three exemplary applications are presented. We show that the plasma
  waves in a laser–plasma accelerator can be detected and located on the optical
  shadowgrams. The plasma wavelength and plasma density are estimated
  accordingly. Furthermore, we present the detection of all the peaks in an
  electron energy spectrum of the accelerated electron beam, and the beam charge
  of each peak is estimated accordingly. Lastly, we demonstrate the detection of
  optical damage in a high-power laser system. The reliability of the object
  detector is demonstrated over 1000 laser shots in each application. Our study
  shows that deep object detection networks are suitable to assist online and
  offline experimental analysis, even with small training sets. We believe that
  the presented methodology is adaptable yet robust, and we encourage further
  applications in Hz-level or kHz-level high-power laser facilities regarding
  the control and diagnostic tools, especially for those involving image data.
