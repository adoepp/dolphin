abstract: Knowledge of spatio-temporal couplings such as pulse-front tilt or curvature
  is important to determine the focused intensity of high-power lasers. Common techniques
  to diagnose these couplings are either qualitative or require hundreds of measurements.
  Here we present both a new algorithm for retrieving spatio-temporal couplings, as
  well as novel experimental implementations. Our method is based on the expression
  of the spatio-spectral phase in terms of a Zernike-Taylor basis, allowing us to
  directly quantify the coefficients for common spatio-temporal couplings. We take
  advantage of this method to perform quantitative measurements using a simple experimental
  setup, consisting of different bandpass filters in front of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront
  sensor. This fast acquisition of laser couplings using narrowband filters, abbreviated
  FALCON, is easy and cheap to implement in existing facilities. To this end, we present
  a measurement of spatio-temporal couplings at the ATLAS-3000 petawatt laser using
  our technique.
